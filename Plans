This file contains the plans for the outline of the project as a whole

Initial Plans:
3 systems:
1)payment
2)management
3)information


Key features:

	1) Should contain Lot_Id

	    The Lot_Id should be a String and should have a format like this:
		F1SE _ _ _
		F2MN_ _ _ _
		F2LE_ _ _ _

		F1 denotes Floor 1
		next character denotes lot-size like, S-> small, M-> medium and L-> large.
		E denotes electric car, N denotes a non-elctric one.

		This way, the user can easily understand where exactly he needs to park his car. Also, the at the time of billing, the person-in-charge/ info-portal can easily know if it's an electric car and thus further rates need to be appied or not(apart from normal parking fee).

		We can maintain a hashmap with indices as F1, F2, F3 to store how many spots are available for use at each floor.
		Similarly we can maintain a hashmap with indices S, M, L.
		The above Lot_id format would let the manager easily update the values in these hashmaps.



	2) Should have:

	i)	 vehicle owner's name
	ii)  issue time
	iii) License no. of vehicle

	3)When user comes back to take away the vehicle, the ticket should be updated by adding the end-time(can't think of some other word presently :) ).

	Note: The payment n other related stuff can be managed seperately under Bill.

}

ticket class works properly
each vehicle generates it's own ticket
each Lot accepts a ticket:
prevented multiple parking in same Lot

exits and entrances:
assign random exits

bill:
1)Bill class is used to generate unique bill objects
2)one-one map between tickets and bills
3)ticket records entry
4)bill records exit

//Hashmap need to be updated upon leaveing the lot
//updated after lot is assigned
A lot is assumed to be "booked" as soon as a ticket for it is issued
thus it is assumed to be filled even if there is no car parked in it

suggestion: let ticket have the lot id, and lot should check the ticket is correct before accepting it

electric_lot:
1)electric lot is simply a special type of lot
2)inherits from Lot
3)extra feature: object of class electric panel

electric lot:
1)logic written to calculalte
2)rate of power, rate per unit watt
